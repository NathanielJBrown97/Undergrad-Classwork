
/*  Cellgrid Overview:
 *
 *  Cellgrid takes a grid of 1's and 0's and stores them as a
 *  1D array of booleans in row-major order.
 *
 *  For Programming Assignment 05, this class will be used to
 *  test problems 1 & 2.
 *
 *  Problem 1 will be tested using the countCells member function
 *  Problem 2 will be tested using the ocuntBlobs member function
 *
 *  Note: in a proper C++ class you would have Getters and Setters
 *  however, here we don't do that since no values change after
 *  the initial construction.
