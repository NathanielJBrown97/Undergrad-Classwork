Problems you can solve using a working version of fgroups:  
**1.)** Support Tickets; suppose a fictitious company has a support department where customers are able to submit tickets for support from the company. Naturally some issues will have greater importance than others. If tickets were submitted with a 'Priority' label indiciating whether it is High, Medium, or Low urgency. Followed by an 'Issue Identifier' which could be selected or filled out from the user. You would effectively sort your issues into a hashmap containing keys (the level of urgency) and values (issues within each urgency group). This could easily be implemented with the fgroups program; although it could be expanded by changing our names:values to an object that contains more prevelant member variables and information to the Issue submitted in this fictitious company.
